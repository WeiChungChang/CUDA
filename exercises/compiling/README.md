# Compiling

In this exercise we will compile and run a simple cuda program
[hello.cu](hello.cu). The code is complete, and does not need to be modified. In
this course we will use both
[Taito-GPU](https://research.csc.fi/taito-gpu) as well as the local
workstations. Try to compile and run the code on both platforms.
